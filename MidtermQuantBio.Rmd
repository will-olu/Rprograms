###Clearly state your hypotheses and draw conclusions at the end for each part.
###(a) (10 points) Using the selected 1000 bases and a Chi-square goodness of fit test,verify if pyrimidines (C or T) and purines (A or G) have equal probabilities.[Remember to use duplex model by doubling observed frequencies]
###(b) (10 points) For your selected sequence, are adjacent nucleotides independent? Use a Chi-square test of independence to verify.###

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

#This question has related parts.
#(a) (5 points) Based on your chosen 1000 bases create a transition matrix 𝑃.
#(b) (1+2 points) Verify if the rows of 𝑃 add up to 1. Why is that?
#(c) (7 points) Using this transition matrix 𝑃 and any initial probability vector 𝜋 of your choice (get creative here!), generate a Markov chain of length 5000.
#(d) (5 points) Repeat 1(b) for this chain you generated. Draw conclusions.



#transition matrix
P<-prop.table(table(ecoli[5000:5999], ecoli[5001:6000]),1)
P

#running a summation of the rows
#The rows equal 1 because each nucleotide is a proportion of the total sequence
rowSums(P)

# C) taking the value of pi and transition matrix P 
pi <-c(1,2,1,2)/4

#using the 
#full nucleotide alphabet
nucleotides <- c("a","c","t","g")
length<-5000# length of the
chain<-rep(NA,length)
chain[1]<-sample(nucleotides,1,p=pi)
chain[1]


for (i in 1:(length-1)){ 
 chain[i+1]<-sample(nucleotides,1,p=P[chain[i],])
 }
head(chain)

xsx <-P%*%P
xsx
#D row sums representing the new Markov chain
rowSums(xsx)




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#This question has related parts.
#(a) (3 points) Estimate 𝑝, the proportion of pyrimidines (C or T) from the chain generated in 2(c).
#(b) (5+2 points) Using the estimate above, provide a 90% confidence interval (CI) for the true 𝑝, proportion of pyrimidines. Interpret the interval.
#(c) (2 points) If you generated another chain, calculated the estimate of 𝑝 and constructed a 90% CI for 𝑝, would your answers be the same as in 3(a), 3(b)? Why or why not?
#(d) (8 points) Simulation: Generate a random sample of size 500 from 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(𝑛 = 1, 𝑝) where 𝑝 = 0.56. Compute an estimate of 𝑝 from this sample and construct a 90% CI for 𝑝. Repeat this process 1000 times. Interpret your findings. (No need to print 1000 CIs).

upperbound<-txg+(z*sqrt(txg*(1-txg)/n))
c(lowerbound,upperbound)

#c)No, the answers will not be the same due to the size of the overall chain.

#d)

for(i in 1:nsim){

}
head(ciResults)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#5. This question has two unrelated parts.
#(a) (10 points) A particular town has two retirement homes A and B. The number of persons vaccinated for COVID-19 in home A has a Binomial distribution with 𝑝 = 0.7. The number of persons vaccinated for COVID-19 in home B has a Binomial distribution with 𝑝 = 0.8. One of the homes is chosen at random (both homes are equally likely) and a sample of 25 is randomly selected. Given that 20 of the 25 persons selected were vaccinated, what is the probability that the sample was taken in home B?
#(b) (10 points) Let 𝑋 be a continuous random variable with pdf:

#Using functions and integration in R, compute 𝐸(𝑋) and 𝑉(𝑋).

##A ~ (n =25, p = 0.7)
